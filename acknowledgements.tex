I would like to thank the Music for accompaning me along this journey we call life, and along the development of this thesis. I definitely wouldn't have done it without you. I encourage anyone reading this thesis to listen to some good music while doing so.

Thanks to my parents and brother for their unconditional love and support.

Thanks to Juan González-Gómez for encouraging me to finish this work, and to do so with the quality self-imposed by my perfectionist mind.

Thanks to Juan G. Víctores for mentoring me along the development of this work. Working with him has been to me a source of invaluable knowledge in science and life.

Thanks to my friends for their support and for those moments of fun and beers.

Thanks also to the people in the lab for  ensuring the humanoid robot TEO was in perfect conditions for our tests with it.

Last but not least, I would like to thank the anonymous donor of the lost red hoodie used to conduct our first experiments. It was extremely useful to set the foundations of this work.
