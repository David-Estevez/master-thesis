\chapter{Garment Segmentation}

This chapter is devoted to the first part of our algorithm, extracting the garment data from the sensor data. Data is obtained as a point cloud, and then converted to a depth image. Then, garment segmentation is perfomed.

\section{Data adquisition}
The starting point of our algorithm is the data adquisition process. Data is obtained as a point cloud from a ASUS Xtion Live sensor. Then, data is converted to a depth map image for its later analysis.
