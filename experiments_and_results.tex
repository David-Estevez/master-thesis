    \caption{Best directions calculated for each garment provided to the system. The direction with the smallest bumpiness value is shown in blue. The second best direction is shown in yellow. The bisector is shown in green. The arrows are for demonstrative purpose only, and their starting and ending point do not represent the pick and place point. The watershed computed regions are additionally overlaid upon the original image.}
